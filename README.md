This repo has data on STRs in Athens, GA.

*`strs_athens.csv` is the raw data created from the PDF

*`athens_strparcels.csv` is a match to parcels/geocoded locations with coordinates

*`athens_strparcels.geojson` is a GeoJSON version of this data for use in GIS.

Coordinates are still rough and will be checked for errors.
